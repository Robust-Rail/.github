## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Robust Rail is the official GitHub organization for public code developed under the Robust Rail initiative, coordinated by the University of Twente. This initiative operates within the framework of the Europeâ€™s Rail Joint Undertaking, aiming to advance the resilience, safety, and intelligence of Europe's rail systems.

Here you'll find open-source software supporting a wide range of research and engineering efforts, from hazmat plate detection and rain synthesis for vision systems, to other key components enhancing the robustness of railway operations.

All datasets are hosted in our dedicated dataset repository to support reproducibility and collaboration.

We welcome researchers, engineers, and contributors who share our mission of building a smarter and more reliable railway infrastructure across Europe.
